Mo is a mustache template rendering software written in bash.  It inserts
environment variables into templates.

Simply put, mo will change {{VARIABLE}} into the value of that
environment variable.  You can use {{#VARIABLE}}content{{/VARIABLE}} to
conditionally display content or iterate over the values of an array.
